## How to Activate VoWiFi and VoLTE on Smart SIM

## 🤔 What They Are:

- **VoLTE** → lets you make voice calls over 4G LTE instead of falling back to 3G/2G. Calls are usually clearer and connect faster.

- **VoWiFi** → lets you make calls over Wi-Fi when your mobile signal is weak. Useful indoors or in areas with poor/without coverage.

## 😄 What You'll Get:

Here’s a benefits list of VoWiFi (Wi-Fi Calling)

- 📞 Calls over Wi-Fi – stay connected even when mobile signal is weak or down.
- 📲 Send and receive SMS/OTP indoors – helpful in malls, basements, or thick-walled buildings with no coverage.
- 🌩️ Reliable after storms or disasters – when cell towers are congested or damaged, as long as Wi-Fi works, you can still call/text.
- 🛫 Works abroad – make calls and send texts using Wi-Fi without roaming charges (depends on carrier policy).
- 💬 Clearer call quality – often better audio than regular cellular calls.
- 💸 Save mobile data – no need to rely on mobile signal if Wi-Fi is available.
- 🔄 Seamless switch with VoLTE – your phone can move between Wi-Fi and LTE calls smoothly.
